Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
=====================

Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This project includes a script called `run_analysis.R` which can be ran against the dataset that is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). A full description of this darta can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Download and extract the archive to a sub-folder of this project named `UCI_HAR_DATASET`. You can then execute the `run_analysis.R` on that dataset which will output the results to a text file named `tidy.txt`

The .gitignore will not add the UCI_HAR_DATASET nor the tidy.txt back to the repository.

A codebook is available in the repository and is named `CodeBook.md`
